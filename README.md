# A-tour-of-Go

Go official documentation has useful tutorials/examples to learn Go. This repo is from the "A Tour of Go" section which has the following: 
  * an interactive introduction to Go in four sections.
  * the first section covers basic syntax and data structures
  * the second discusses methods and interfaces
  * the third is about Generics
  * the fourth introduces Go's concurrency primitives. 
Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've learned. 

This repository contains my programs for the exercises and more..
