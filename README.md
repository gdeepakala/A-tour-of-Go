# A-tour-of-Go

Go official documentation has useful tutorials/examples to learn Go. This repo is from the "A Tour of Go" section which has the following: 
  # An interactive introduction to Go in four sections. 
  # The first section covers basic syntax and data structures; 
  # the second discusses methods and interfaces; 
  # the third is about Generics; and the fourth introduces Go's concurrency primitives. 
Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've learned. 

This repository contains my programs for the exercises and more..
